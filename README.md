This package is derived from the Arduino Zero (package: Arduino SAMD Boards (32-bit ARM Cortex-M0+), see my article here: https://www.avdweb.nl/arduino/samd21/samd21-variant


### NOTES:
- Serial (aka Serial 0, aka Sercom5) is disabled so that the user may define it to be whatever they wish.  Serial1 remains as is
- USB is not enabled at start, if you want to use USB with this board definition, you will have to figure it out for yourself
